    description: 'I bring a well-rounded mix of technical and soft skills to the table. On the tech side, I work across the full stack with languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React, Django, and Flask. I have experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), data tools (Pandas, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch), big data technologies (Kafka, Hadoop), and GenAI concepts like RAG and vector databases. Alongside these, I value strong communication, problem-solving, adaptability, and teamwork—key soft skills that support effective collaboration and continuous learning. and adaptability. I love working in teams and being creative! If you want to dive deeper into any specific skill, just let me know!'};
